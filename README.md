# Final-Project-End-of-the-World-Game-Jam
Defend the world.  Kill the AI.  Upgrade your defenses.  Don't die.

This is our project that we're making for our Game Technology class.  We have two days to do it on top of a bunch of other things and life is suffering.

The goal is to create an upgrade-based space shooter in which you have to simply survive as long as you can against an invading enemy horde.  I (Larry) have drawn all the pixel spritework and most of the created assets; Nick and Jacob were the amazing souls that worked towards programming the whole thing into existence using whatever the heck Godot is on about.
